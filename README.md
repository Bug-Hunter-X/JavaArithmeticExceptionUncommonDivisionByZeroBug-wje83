# Java ArithmeticException: Uncommon Division by Zero Bug

This repository demonstrates a simple yet easily overlooked bug in Java: division by zero.  The `UncommonBug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `UncommonBugSolution.java` presents a corrected version.

**Uncommon Nature:**  While division by zero is a fundamental programming error, it can be surprisingly difficult to catch, particularly in more complex code where the zero division isn't immediately obvious. This example highlights a common scenario where a variable's value is unexpectedly zero, leading to the exception.
